This project focuses on a guessing game, guessing the names of Pokémon (1st generation), with 6 attempts and certain clues. It's a primitive program, in the future more features could be added such as a better graphical interface, more clues, more Pokémon, and additional mechanics.
There is a .jar file available to run the program; there is no .exe file for running it.
